This project is inspired in some ways by the modality introduced by [Poke](https://poke.com/) to interact with and communicate with agents. I love the flexibility of Poke through iMessage and it's simple architecture, but I want to move away from using my phone and texting.

Along similar lines, I write a lot and often keep to-do lists in my notebook. There are many cases where I end up with a backlog of tasks that I haven't completed, but agents could very easily help me with them (drafting emails, scheduling meetings, etc.).

Putting two and two together, I want to endeavor to create a system that allows me to interact with agents in a more natural and flexible way, bridging some form of physical and digital communication. I also want to explore ways of improving the architecture and performance of agentic systems, and to develop a more robust and scalable framework for building and deploying agents and tools.
